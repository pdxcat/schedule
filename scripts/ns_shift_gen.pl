# ns_shift_gen.pl
# Generates entries for ns_shift.

# Functionality
# -Generate shifts in one hour blocks, only on Monday through Friday, 8-6, Saturday 12-6.
# -Skip holidays in ns_holiday.
# -Should be smart enough to not need a specific day to start on, unlike current script which requires a monday.

# Arguments to take
# -Start date and end date to generate shifts between, or a term name.

# Main loop
# -Check arguments, make sure we get two dates in yyyy-mm-dd format and put
#  these into $start_date and $end_date
# -Call getholidays() and build a list of dates to ignore for purposes of populating ns_shift.
# -Step through each date in between the start and end dates and generate shifts appropriately based on the day of the week.

# Subroutines
# -Build list of holidays from entries in ns_holiday
# -Loop to go through each valid hour for a day and create an appropriate number of shifts for each of hours based on the number of seats we have.
# -Insert record into ns_shift
